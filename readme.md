Into the Ice: A Virtual Reality Experience:
'Into the Ice' is the website for a new virtual reality experience that aims to educate visitors on one of the most misunderstood periods of human history - the Stone Age - using a combination of exciting new technology and interactive education programs. The site is aimed at people that are looking for a way to learn about history in an immersive, visual way. Into the Ice functions to inform potential visitors about the experience, to provide information about suitability and the content of the experience, to allow potential visitors to book their experience, and to allow them to view images and testimonials from previous visitors.

Features:

-Navigation Bar:
Featuring on all five pages of the website, the navigation bar displays icons with links to the centre's bookings portal, the gallery/testimonials page, the gift shop, and the contact information page. This navigation bar provides seamless navigation across all five pages via the clicking of clean-cut, attractive icons.

Landing Page/Home (index.html):
The landing page/home page of Into the Ice features three circular images with an overlay of dramatic titular text introducing the experience and the address of the centre so as to immediately inform potential visitors of its location. The dramatic and graphic overlay is eyegrabbing and interesting, so as to capture the attention of the site's user.
Further down the page, a text overlay details the story of the VR experience and gives a brief overview of the experience onsite. This very quickly gives the user an idea of what to expect should they book a slot.

Booking portal (booking.html):
Linked clearly on the landing page, the booking portal will allow the user to book their experience at the Into the Ice centre. It includes a crisp, clearly-marked calendar that the user can go through month by month in order to check availability. A dropdown note advises the user to book in advance for their visit, as the VR experience books up very quickly.

Footer:
The footer displays four icons linking the user to social media accounts associated with Into the Ice that open to new tabs. These links are useful to the user for the purpose of viewing other vistor's interactions with Into the Ice, for keeping up to date with Into the Ice via their social media accounts, and for possible inquiries or questions they may have that can be answered via direct message on the aforementioned social medias.

Gallery (gallery.html):
The Into the Ice gallery provides the user with images that depict what the VR experience entails, as well as the visitor centre. Gallery sections are valuable to the site user as they quickly visually identify what the user can expect when visiting the centre. The gallery section also includes several overlays showing testimonials from previous visitors.

Gift shop (store.html):
This page provides the user with a preview of what can be purchased from the Into the Ice centre's gift shop. Four items - a child's toy, a piece of artisan confectionery, a piece of jewellery, and an arts and crafts book - are pictured in an online-shopping format, and they give the user an idea of what kinds of gifts and souvenirs are available for purchase at the centre. The user is informed via a text overlay that there is no current availability for online purchases, but is directed towards an entry form into which they can enter their email to be informed when the online store is launched.

Features Left to Implement:


Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Validator Testing
HTML
No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator
CSS
No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator
Unfixed Bugs
You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub)

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

Credits
In this section you need to reference where you got your content, media and extra help from. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials, however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid plagiarism.

You can break the credits section up into Content and Media, depending on what you have included in your project.

Other General Project Advice
Below you will find a couple of extra tips that may be helpful when completing your project. Remember that each of these projects will become part of your final portfolio so it’s important to allow enough time to showcase your best work!

One of the most basic elements of keeping a healthy commit history is with the commit message. When getting started with your project, read through this article by Chris Beams on How to Write a Git Commit Message

Make sure to keep the messages in the imperative mood
When naming the files in your project directory, make sure to consider meaningful naming of files, point to specific names and sections of content.

For example, instead of naming an image used ‘image1.png’ consider naming it ‘landing_page_img.png’. This will ensure that there are clear file paths kept.
Do some extra research on good and bad coding practices, there are a handful of useful articles to read, consider reviewing the following list when getting started:
