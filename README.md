# ICEBERGVR
A software development project for the website of a fictional virtual reality experience.
Into the Ice: A Virtual Reality Experience:
'Into the Ice' is the website for a new virtual reality experience that aims to educate visitors on one of the most misunderstood periods of human history - the Stone Age - using a combination of exciting new technology and interactive education programs. The site is aimed at people that are looking for a way to learn about history in an immersive, visual way. Into the Ice functions to inform potential visitors about the experience, to provide information about suitability and the content of the experience, to allow potential visitors to book their experience, and to allow them to view images and testimonials from previous visitors.

I used Replit.com to write the code, as I was initially unsure about writing it in GitHub itself, and found Replit far easier to work with.

Features:

-Navigation Bar:
Featuring on all pages of the website, the navigation bar displays icons with links to the centre's bookings portal, the gallery/testimonials page, the gift shop, and the contact information page. This navigation bar provides seamless navigation across all five pages via the clicking of clean-cut, attractive links.

Landing Page/Home (index.html):
The landing page/home page of Into the Ice features an overlay of dramatic titular text introducing the experience and the address of the centre so as to immediately inform potential visitors of its location. The dramatic and graphic overlay is eyegrabbing and interesting, so as to capture the attention of the site's user.
Further down the page, a text overlay details the story of the VR experience and gives a brief overview of the experience onsite, including details about health and safety at the centre, the centre tour, and the studio tour. This very quickly gives the user an idea of what to expect should they book a slot.

Booking portal (booking.html):
Linked clearly on the landing page, the booking portal will allow the user to book their experience at the Into the Ice centre. It includes a crisp, clearly-marked calendar that the user can go through month by month in order to check availability. The user can choose from three packages, clearly marked in a dropdown menu, and can book for a minumum of 1 adult per visit. An initial note advises the user to book in advance for their visit, as the VR experience books up very quickly. The layout is clear and crisp in order to avoid any confusion while booking.

Footer:
The footer displays four icons linking the user to social media accounts (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok) associated with Into the Ice that open to new tabs. These links are useful to the user for the purpose of viewing other vistor's interactions with Into the Ice, for keeping up to date with Into the Ice via their social media accounts, and for possible inquiries or questions they may have that can be answered via direct message on the aforementioned social medias.

Gallery (gallery.html):
The Into the Ice gallery provides the user with images that depict what the VR experience entails, as well as the visitor centre. Gallery sections are valuable to the site user as they quickly visually identify what the user can expect when visiting the centre. The gallery section also includes three overlays showing testimonials from previous visitors, all of whom have experienced a different package (Standard, Silver, and Gold, respectively)

Gift shop (store.html):
This page informs the user that the online shop is under construction. It provides the user with an idea of what can be purchased from the Into the Ice centre's gift shop. The user is offered the option to enter their email to be notified when the online shop goes live, which includes a 15% off their first order offer. The social media links are also featured at the base of the page.

Contact page (contact.html):
The contact page includes the address, phone number, and email address of the VR centre. It offers the user the option to create an account with the website in order to access further information regarding their bookings, etc. This requests an email, a password, and a first and last name. The social media links are also featured at the base of the page.


Features Left to Implement:
I would have liked to have had a product page for the items potentially sold in the gift shop, complete with the ability to add items to a cart and have a total and shipping cost calculated, but ultimately that did not come to be in this project - however I would like to implement something similar in future projects.

Testing:
As requested by Code Institute criteria, I have tested the entirety of the website through the W3C validators for both HTML and CSS. My CSS, as of writing this readme.md, has minor issues, and I will include a screenshot supporting that here.

HTML validation found minor issues cropping up, as can be seen in the supplied screenshots, but the vast majority of the site functions perfectly on different screens and browsers. Mobile interaction with the site functions very well. One interesting thing I did find was that the Bookings page seemed to minimise slightly when viewed via Microsoft Edge. Overall, extensive testing has shown me that the site flows well and is entirely user-friendly.


Validator Testing
HTML: See 'unfixed bug' heading.
CSS: Minor errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator, thoughI seemed to be unable to fix the small issues as it was an issue of font existence.

Unfixed Bugs: A 'hidden attribute' bug seemed to plague me during this project, as seen in these screenshots here, and I am not certain of the exact way to completely fix them. However, in the grand scheme of the project, these bugs are minor and do not affect the running of the site in any way that I am aware of.

Deployment:
I utilised GitHub for this step. I downloaded my project as an entire zip file from Replit, then uploaded them to my Github account. Then I navigated to the settings tab in Github repository, then selected Pages from Settings. I then selected master/main branch and deployed my project. I used this tutorial - - to help me as I was unsure. Despite using the tutorial, I still managed to accidentally upload a previous version of my readme.md file, and so I had to delete that from the commit and reupload.

PLEASE NOTE:
Some segments of code are from various links as inserted below, but not all code in all of the links was used.
-All icons, unless specified otherwise, are from a Font Awesome kit.
-https://www.w3schools.com/css/ - W3Schools' CSS section was hugely helpful to me when creating my dropdown menus and email submission sections, as their tutorials are indepth and simple at the same time. Their 'try it yourself' option helps hugely in allowing me to create my own code via their tryit editor, which then allowed me to use the same methods on my project.
